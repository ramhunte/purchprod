<span  style="font-size:1.5em;">This Shiny App (built in R) is designed to show various facets of the production of fisheries catch data relating to the purchase and production of the US west coast fisheries.
It is a tool that has been developed to assist the Economic Data Collection Program at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center make data available to the public.</span>

### Using the app

<span  style="font-size:1.5em;">The **Overview** page provides a broad look the production value and weight of species across years. In the top left hand corner, use the **Select a year** drop down 
to filter a data to a year that you are wanting to investigate. You can then compare this to the average across a range of years or another single year in the 
**Select a date range** slider. By clicking and dragging the slider, you can adjust the date range. If you want to compare to a single year, drag both ends of the 
date range onto the same point so that only one single year is selected.</span>


<span  style="font-size:1.5em;">The **Explore the Data** page provides a more granular look 
at metrics, statistics, and other variables related to the data and how they change over time. Data can be viewed as a summary, by product type, and by species. Filtered data can be downloaded using the **DOWNLOAD** button at the 
bottom of the left hand side panel. Data can be viewed both as a time series plot and in tabular form using the **Plot** and **Table** panels.</span>

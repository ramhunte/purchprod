## About the app
<br>

<div style="font-size:1.2em;">

This Shiny App (built in R) is a tool that was developed to assist the Economic Data Collection (EDC) program at the
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center" target="_blank">Northwest Fisheries Science Center</a> 
make its economic data available to the public. It aggregates, summarizes, and compares various facets of this data pertaining to 
the purchase and production of the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program.

The data presented here were collected through the EDC program from shorebased processors that purchase bottom groundfish, midwater 
groundfish, and Pacific hake from catcher vessels participating in the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share program. It includes 
all fish caught under the program, as well as additional species purchased by these facilities.

Data collection is conducted annually as required by <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-660/subpart-D/section-660.114" target="_blank">regulation 50 CFR 660.114</a>. 
A First Receiver Site License (FRSL) authorizes a buyer to 
receive, purchase, or take possession of an Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) landing at a specific onshore location. Each buyer must hold an 
FRSL for every site where IFQ landings are offloaded.

### Using the app 
<br>

The **Overview** page provides a broad look the production value and weight of species across years. In the top left hand corner, use the **Select a year** drop down 
to filter data to a single year that you are wanting to investigate. You can then compare this to the average across a range of years or another single year in the 
**Select a date range** slider below. By clicking and dragging the slider, you can adjust the date range. If you want to compare to a single year, drag both ends of the 
date range onto the same year so that only one single year is selected.


The **Explore the Data** page provides a more granular look 
at metrics, statistics, and other variables related to the data and how they change over time. Data can be viewed as a summary, by product type, or by species. Filtered data can be downloaded using the **DOWNLOAD** button at the 
bottom of the left hand side panel. Data can be viewed both as a time series plot or in tabular form using the **Plot** and **Table** panels on the right hand side.

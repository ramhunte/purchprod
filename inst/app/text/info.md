### Using the app 
<br>

The **Overview** page provides a broad look the production value and weight of species across years. In the top left hand corner, use the **Select a year** drop down 
to filter data to a single year that you are wanting to investigate. You can then compare this to the average across a range of years or another single year in the 
**Select a date range** slider below. By clicking and dragging the slider, you can adjust the date range. If you want to compare to a single year, drag both ends of the 
date range onto the same year so that only one single year is selected.


The **Explore the Data** page provides a more granular look 
at metrics, statistics, and other variables related to the data and how they change over time. Data can be viewed as a summary, by product type, or by species. Filtered data can be downloaded using the **DOWNLOAD** button at the 
bottom of the left hand side panel. Data can be viewed both as a time series plot or in tabular form using the **Plot** and **Table** panels on the right hand side.

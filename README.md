## ðŸ§­ About the app

This Shiny App (built in R) is a tool that was developed to assist the
Economic Data Collection Program at the
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center" target="_blank">Northwest
Fisheries Science Center</a> make its fisheries data available to the
public. Data is collected annually from the West Coast Groundfish Trawl
Fishery as required by
<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-660/subpart-D/section-660.114" target="_blank">regulation
50 CFR 660.114</a>. This app aggregates, summarizes, and compares
various facets of this data pertaining to the purchase and production of
the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Catch Share Program.

### Notes for Developers

This app was built using the `{golem}` framework, which structures Shiny
applications as R packages to support modular design, easier testing,
and long-term maintainability and collaboration. The appâ€™s
componentsâ€”UI, server logic, and supporting functionsâ€”are organized into
clearly separated scripts (`fct_*.R`, `utils_*.R`) and modules
(`mod_*.R`), making the codebase easier to navigate, test, and extend.
Configuration settings are managed through the `golem-config.yml` file,
which centralizes environment-specific options. To ensure
reproducibility across systems and time, the project also uses `{renv}`
to lock package versions. The `renv.lock` file captures the exact
versions of all packages used during development, allowing collaborators
to recreate the same environment with `renv::restore()`. If contributing
to this application, please follow the `{golem}` and `{renv}`
conventions to maintain consistency and reliability throughout
development.

## âœ¨ Features

### **Overview page**

- A broad look at species catch value and weight by year
- Compare total production value and weight of species over time
- Select a specific year of interest and compare it to another year or
  average over multiple years
  - Use the **year selector** and **date range slider** to customize the
    comparison

### **Explore the Data**

- A more granular look into the facets of the data with tabs including:
  - **Summary**
  - **By Product Type**
  - **By Species**
- Filter by a metric, statistic, region, processor type, and more
- View output as interactive time series plots or downloadable tables

### **Information**

- Learn how the app works and understand key terms and filters
